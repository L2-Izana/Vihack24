Once staff unlocked the door, we entered and found an absolute mess and faeces on the toilet seat. To say we were disgusted is an understatement.

First and foremost, I discovered mucus in my drink, which is utterly unacceptable and disgusting. To make matters worse, there was saliva on my food, indicating a severe lack of cleanliness and respect for customers. This kind of negligence is intolerable and raises serious health concerns. Additionally, I wasn't even provided with a straw for my drink, adding to the already dismal experience. This level of oversight and carelessness is shocking for a global fast-food chain that should prioritise customer satisfaction and hygiene.

The Cotoletta sandwich was outstanding—the bread was perfectly toasted, and the combination of fresh vegetables and crispy breaded meat was simply delightful. It comes highly recommended. The Meatball sandwich, on the other hand, featured four large meatballs and a generous amount of cheese stuffed into half a large loaf of bread, which was incredibly filling.

This panini was super loaded and was pretty good. 8/10.\\nSalami ($16) - This was also good, however, the ratio of bread to salami ratio was super off, the bread was too much it was like WAY too much bread compared to the salami. But, we really liked the flavour combo of the salami with the provolone cheese, peppers and eggplant. 6.8/10.\\nProsciutto ($16) - This was the most disappointing one that we tried. There was barely any prosciutto and there wasn’t much flavour to it. It was not worth it. 6/10.\\n\\nOverall, I liked it but I wouldn’t be coming back any time soon. I feel like if I have to add on other things to make the panini better, than it is just not worth the price. The cotoletta panini ended up being $21 because of the add ons.\\n\\nRating: 7/10']\n",

Even though I typically don't enjoy beef, this Italian restaurant made it so delicious that I couldn't resist.

The potatoes dipped in sauce combined with a bite of beef created an amazing sensation in my mouth. I wished I had two stomachs to eat more! 😭\\n\\n🍝 The third one, white sauce pasta, was also delightful. It had a rich oiliness that wasn't greasy at all.

The salmon was not fresh; the butter fish sashimi tasted fishy; the beef tataki was not good quality beef; the fried rice was tasteless and even adding soya sauce didn’t help; the unagi (eel) was soft and mushy (bad quality); the so-called grilled fish was not mackerel as you would have thought, it was basa fish fillets which actually looked like it was pan fried with some sauce; the prawn tempura batter was thick and not light and airy (in fact it’s similar to Costco tempura prawns); the curry chicken katsu had starchy gravy and the chicken meat tasted like it was tenderised (although the deep frying was well fried). Overall, I would say that it is below average and for the price we paid at $55 per person, we could have had better food elsewhere. The selection is very limited.

Here's why:\\n\\n- acai taste is quite bland and portion is deceiving - we found that in comparison to other competitors, it lacks taste of the acai itself. Maybe it's just not a strong acai taste and more bland? Maybe they use more ice or other ingredients besides acai? Not sure. Also it looks like a good portion but actually there is a massive gap in the middle?! These would be the reasons for the 3 star and not 5. Consistency is still good despite the taste and portion.\\n- toppings - the granola is small in portion but amazing taste and along with the biscoff or nutella sauce (you pay extra but would recommend) is perfect. However it quite sad that with the other toppings you only get 1 strawberry (just 1, seriously?) and less than half banana. Again why I am giving 3 stars.\\n- price is reasonable\\n\\nLooks more impressive than what it actually is - it definitely quite a few things to improve!\", 'Ivanhoe East is so fortunate to have The Lorri in the area!

I must say, the suburban pricing is quite reasonable.\\n\\n- Unagi Sushi $22\\nI particularly loved the unagi sushi here, with its subtle charcoal aroma. I devoured half of it myself, thanks to my dining companions :)\\n\\n- Sushi Boat $38\\nThis dish, also listed as House Moriawase, is supposedly a single serving, but it was more than enough for the three of us. The ingredients were fresh, and the sashimi had a delicate sweetness.\\n\\n- Wafu Steak $34\\nThe beef was incredibly tender, melting in the mouth with a rich, flavorful sauce. It was accompanied by a side of vegetables, making for a balanced and satisfying dish.\\n\\n- Nabeyaki Udon $20\\nThe udon was perfectly chewy and a broth that was rich and flavorful. It was nice and comforting.\\n\\nMany of the patrons seemed to be local residents, adding to their homely vibe. If I had to point out a flaw, it would be the slightly slow service, possibly due to the weekend crowd.', \"A very average Japanese restaurant that clearly was quite popular in the area.\\n\\nWe had the sushi boat, beef yaki soba, teriyaki chicken roll and agedashi tofu.\\n\\nThe teriyaki chicken didn't have much flavour.

Small premises that is very popular with lots of takeaway and dine-in customers keeping the single front of house person very busy.\\n\\nWe had miso soup, fresh oysters, beef tataki, nasu dengaku (eggplant baked with sweet miso sauce), and tempura moriwase, all washed down with heated sake.\\n\\nFolks, everything was perfect, tasty and fresh, just like you would find in Japan itself. A delicious dinner with an amazing hostess who remembers everything that needs to be done for every table and does it efficiently and with a smile. Arigato!', 'Best Japanese restaurant in the area!

The cold brew has also sometimes tasted a bit 'mossy' due to either the water that was used during production, or fridge/open air oxidation, or perhaps the overall flavour profile of the beans that are used. Some refinement on these items would make them amazing for the coffee purist crowd!\\n\\nAs someone with heightened social anxiety, I thank you for being so hospitable and lovely towards myself and my family. The positive attitudes, attention and effort from the staff is always greatly appreciated.\", 'Fell in love with when we went through the red door.

      "[\"I admire a burger that's thin, cooked to perfection, and made with fresh ingredients and quality bread. This restaurant I visited nailed it. The burgers are delicious, juicy, and full of flavor. The bread is soft and fresh, making the perfect match for the fillings. The fried chicken here is also outstanding—crispy, flavorful, and tender. The service is efficient and friendly, and the setting is warm and welcoming. I highly recommend this place to all burger and fried chicken fans.\", 'So disappointed in the ‘scalable’ fish burger, it’s $15.50 and the fillet doesn’t even take up half of the burger bun. My friend also got one and her fillet was the same size. Notable size difference to what is advertised. I’ve had the chicken burger in the past, it was good and a decent size. Chips were nice and well seasoned.', 'Beyond disappointed. Lukewarm food and service.\\n\\nWe ordered two burgers, a large fries and one thick shake at 8:00pm last night. In total, 3 customers to literally 6 staff including the others waiting. It would take 30 minutes for our order to be finished, despite this.\\n\\nIn that time, four of the staff members were mainly arguing and talking by the food warmers. They didn’t interact at all with the young girl serving at the window, so while we frustrated customers were outside, she didn’t have any answers to provide us (not her fault at all). They ignored her and us for most of the 30 minutes.\\n\\nIt turned out our food had been cooked and sitting under a warmer for who knows how long, and we were waiting 30 minutes on a milkshake.\\n\\nNo explanation, no offer to substitute the milkshake to save our time, no partial refund. When we walked the less than 5 min home, the burgers were lukewarm and the fries cold. We debated microwaving it all but were too hungry by that time.\\n\\nFor $52? What a joke. Plenty of great spots on high street for a similar price point with better service.', 'I had the beef n bacon double it was pretty good In terms of freshness. Everything looked and tasted super fresh. My only issue was the sauce it needed some more flavour to really kick the burger in high gear. I believe that when making a burger if you find the balance between meety flavour and sauce it would be an absolute smash. The chips were really crispy and not too salty.', 'Burger looked exactly the way advertised. Beef was on point and seasoned perfectly. Not a big fan of fried chicken but their southern fried bites made me change my mind. However, potato fries could be improved.\\nGlad to find a new HALAL joint. Highly Recommended!']\n",

The mock meat dishes were particularly impressive!\\n\\nThe chicken dumplings were perfectly steamed and packed with savoury fillings, while the kimchi noodles had just the right amount of kick to tantalise our taste buds, the chilli sauce used was amazing. The lemon chicken was a standout dish, with a tangy sauce that complemented the tender mock meat beautifully.

As a devoted vegan, finding a restaurant that not only offers mouthwatering dishes but also delivers exceptional service is a rare treat. From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. The variety on the menu is impressive, and every dish we tried was bursting with flavor. The rotty and chicken curry were delightful, the Nasi Goreng was a flavorful journey, and the peanut satay udon noodles left us craving for more. And let's talk about Bon's fried chicken and the crispy buttermilk chicken burger – absolute game-changers! And don't even get me started on the gelato – a heavenly finale to an already extraordinary meal. The staff were incredibly attentive, ensuring our dining experience was nothing short of perfect. Plus, the easy parking around the back made getting there a breeze.

Worst of this dish is they put the bread into the soup, which makes it gross and I couldn’t throw it out quick enough as the bread was very soggy, melt into the soup, not sure why they bothered toasting the bread then put it right into the soup, what’s the point? The scrambled egg was even worse, the eggs were over cooked to well done omelette and not scrambled, the avocado was darkened yet over killed with lime/lemon juice (very sour I couldn’t eat it) the bread was half cooked (one slice was done okay the other slice was soft).
