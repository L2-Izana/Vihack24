Other dishes like Pad Thai and Fried Rice were really good, too. The Papaya Salad was okay (lacked a little flavour and acidity). Only the duck dish was disappointing; Lacked flavour, sauce seemed uninspired, and definetely lacking duck. Unfortunately, some of us did not even get to try a piece.

Initially, the bar staff were attentive, but upon the arrival of our roast, priced at $34, my anticipation waned. While the beef was satisfactory, the broccolini was served raw, the Yorkshire pudding was dense like a sponge, and the potatoes lacked the desired crispiness. As a purveyor of Sunday roasts, it's imperative that such staples are executed flawlessly. Upon expressing our dissatisfaction to the waitress, she acknowledged the shortcomings. After a brief wait, the manager approached us to inquire about our discontentment. It was expressed, in jest, that the individual responsible for the Yorkshire pudding's preparation should be dismissed. Regrettably, this lighthearted comment was misconstrued. As a British patron, I trust you can appreciate the intent behind such humor. In conclusion, I advise potential patrons seeking a quality Sunday roast to look elsewhere.

Visited plenty of times, consistently fantastic food and great customer service that goes above and beyond most other places in this area. A very cozy vibe overall, however when it's busy it can get a bit loud and overstimulating given the seating layout - especially when other patrons bring along their crying children.\\n\\nI highly recommend any of their breakfast items as well as the burger. The tarts are also spot-on in terms of crust and filling and are always best when you can get them while they're fresh! The prices are balanced and reflect the effort that is put into each menu item, as well as their premium quality of ingredients. They also have great options for high-protein lovers and it's a great spot for post-workout nourishment!\\n\\nA few small notes for improvement though - The double espresso can sometimes be quite watery and acidic, which is understandable given the peak coffee-rush on most mornings which leads to a higher running temperature of the machine. The cold brew has also sometimes tasted a bit 'mossy' due to either the water that was used during production, or fridge/open air oxidation, or perhaps the overall flavour profile of the beans that are used. Some refinement on these items would make them amazing for the coffee purist crowd!\\n\\nAs someone with heightened social anxiety, I thank you for being so hospitable and lovely towards myself and my family. The positive attitudes, attention and effort from the staff is always greatly appreciated.\", 'Fell in love with when we went through the red door.

The service is efficient and friendly, and the setting is warm and welcoming.

In total, 3 customers to literally 6 staff including the others waiting. It would take 30 minutes for our order to be finished, despite this.\\n\\nIn that time, four of the staff members were mainly arguing and talking by the food warmers. They didn’t interact at all with the young girl serving at the window, so while we frustrated customers were outside, she didn’t have any answers to provide us (not her fault at all). They ignored her and us for most of the 30 minutes.\\n\\nIt turned out our food had been cooked and sitting under a warmer for who knows how long, and we were waiting 30 minutes on a milkshake.\\n\\nNo explanation, no offer to substitute the milkshake to save our time, no partial refund. When we walked the less than 5 min home, the burgers were lukewarm and the fries cold. We debated microwaving it all but were too hungry by that time.\\n\\nFor $52? What a joke. Plenty of great spots on high street for a similar price point with better service.', 'I had the beef n bacon double it was pretty good In terms of freshness. Everything looked and tasted super fresh. My only issue was the sauce it needed some more flavour to really kick the burger in high gear. I believe that when making a burger if you find the balance between meety flavour and sauce it would be an absolute smash. The chips were really crispy and not too salty.', 'Burger looked exactly the way advertised. Beef was on point and seasoned perfectly.
