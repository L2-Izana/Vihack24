Bring your business partners. Even if it takes an hour on the train to get here. Best frozen yoghurt ever | Yo-chi is always a wonderful place to go whether, your with friends, family, or even by yourself. It‚Äôs cool, refreshing, filling, authentic, and tastes very good. The flavours and toppings change with trends and time, keeping them fresh and new.
C the service is always nice and ready to help. They offer tasting so if you are unsure, make sure you ask a staff member. The atmosphere is nice, in a rustic-modern sort of way, also allowing room for a lot of customers. It makes you feel warm and welcome as you stem inside. There is good climate control for both hot and cold days, and I definitely recommend paying this venue a visit. | Location is great as it is close to the Glenferrie train station and is in the centre of all other nice shops + Lido cinemas. Very spacious inside with lots of seating. A huge array of toppings and it‚Äôs always super fresh. Highly recommend the warm section where they serve brownies and cookies and hot fudge and melted chocolate. Extremely busy around 4-5 pm and during the evenings. However, management and staff are very efficient and swift so the line is not long at all. | Nice and tasty! Will come back again. I love self services | A much loved Melbourne institution!

Reliably amazing froyo with classic plus new / rotating flavours that keep it interesting, and a broad range of toppings. They also provide tap and sparkling water available which is nice.

Fantastic, friendly and attentive service, who keep the place clean and manage a fun and relaxed atmosphere, for kids, families, teenagers even when the place fills up - especially in the weekend summer evenings.

Go for a swim nearby, then pick up Yo-Chi, pick up some groceries and head to the bookshop - perfect summer evening sorted!"

Not only were staff inattentive to people, their toilets were locked with signs saying we had to show receipt proof of a McDonald‚Äôs purchase at that store so that we could use the bathroom. A little ridiculous if you ask me, people shouldn‚Äôt have to ask permission and show proof of purchase to go to the bathroom. Once staff unlocked the door, we entered and found an absolute mess and faeces on the toilet seat. To say we were disgusted is an understatement. It‚Äôs clear that staff don‚Äôt clean their toilets regularly enough or at all because they had no idea about the putrid state their bathroom was in. Absolutely revolting. | Mc chicken sauce given less than a spoon.
Better not to have the option on the menu. | Atmosphere of the place is busy and livelyüòÑüòÑ. Service is better than before now. The manager and staff are very cooperative if customers have issue with their order. Food was decent! Had 2-3 odd experience!! But overall good job to the team working üëçüëç | Hair in burger (very stuck - I have very coily hair, definitely not mine). Coffee quite slow. Lids sometimes not closed properly - coffee was spilled. Employees seem nice?? They probably need more staff but yeah sorry this McDonald's sucks. üôÅ | Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.
I recently had an appalling experience at McDonald‚Äôs that I feel compelled to share. My visit was nothing short of disgraceful, and I am deeply disappointed by the level of hygiene and service. First and foremost, I discovered mucus in my drink, which is utterly unacceptable and disgusting. To make matters worse, there was saliva on my food, indicating a severe lack of cleanliness and respect for customers. This kind of negligence is intolerable and raises serious health concerns. Additionally, I wasn't even provided with a straw for my drink, adding to the already dismal experience. This level of oversight and carelessness is shocking for a global fast-food chain that should prioritise customer satisfaction and hygiene. Overall, this was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I will not be returning to this location and urge others to reconsider visiting until significant improvements are made"

Not overly spicy. Mushroom chicken soup is a must order especially during winter. We loved their fried rice with mushroom. The only thing I wouldn't order again is their lemon rice wine, too sweet for me. | One of the best Chinese restaurants in Melbourne in my opinion featuring Yunnan specialties that are even hard to find in China. Everything was displayed beautifully and tasted fantastic- all for a reasonable price too. Would come back for more | Decent regional Chinese cuisine on offer here. Group dining highly recommended as dishes are designed to share. Their house made rice wine is something you don't see often enough, considering how delicious it can be! Overall we felt the meal was nice if a bit expensive. | A friend originally from Nanjing brought us to her fav Chinese restaurant in Hawthorn. It was a colourful and delicious experience indeed.

The noodle dish is cooked in a big piping hot bowl of soup together with the elements. The crispy eggplant is a win and the creamy yet spicy tofu is lovely.

Would have preferred the fried rice to be less oily although its yums! | Solid meal! Is quite pricy but the foods and drinks are really really really nice. Like incredibly perfect, no room for criticism type of food ‚Ä¶. üòã

The only downside is that it takes quite a long time for the food to come, but could‚Äôve just been a Mother‚Äôs Day situation ü§î

We tried their signature Cotoletta sandwich ($16) and their new Meatball sandwich ($20). The Cotoletta sandwich was outstanding‚Äîthe bread was perfectly toasted, and the combination of fresh vegetables and crispy breaded meat was simply delightful. It comes highly recommended. The Meatball sandwich, on the other hand, featured four large meatballs and a generous amount of cheese stuffed into half a large loaf of bread, which was incredibly filling. The meatballs had the classic flavor you'd expect from those in Italian pasta dishes.

Overall, it's a great spot, and I'm looking forward to trying other sandwiches on their menu next time. | Piccolo is super busy during the lunch rush, and there is typically a line. To avoid this, I found it‚Äôs best to attend before 11am üòÅ because it‚Äôs gets super busy!

Here we ordered iced coffees, the popular cotoletta and salami panini. The paninis were so loaded, filling and even half of each panini is so filling so you can save the other half!

The service was really friendly and gave a relaxed atmosphere. | All paninis are made on a freshly baked focaccia as the bread - which was perfectly crunchy and fluffy!
We tried the cotoletta, proscuitto and mortadella, the mortadella being my favourite!
Great service, lovely staff and great vibes. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more of a takeaway spot as there‚Äôs limited seating. Wait time can be up to 45 minutes. | We visited shortly after 10am and the wait time wasn‚Äôt long at all. Nice coffee, tasty panini and really friendly staff!! We tried the:

üå∂Ô∏è Cotoletta Panino w/ Chilli & Peppers
üçØ Mortadella Panino
üßä Iced Oat Latte
üßä Iced Latte

The focaccia was fluffy and the panini were filled very generously! Love that the cotoletta was freshly cooked - flavourful and crispy. The mortadella with stracciatella, pistachios and honey was fresh - such a classic combo. | We finally tried the viral paninis and here are our honest thoughts on what we had.

Cotoletta ($16) - The cotoletta is the best panini that we tried, we added on chilli oil ($1.5) and something else that I don‚Äôt remember because the music was so loud that I could barely hear what the cashier recommended. This panini was super loaded and was pretty good. 8/10.
Salami ($16) - This was also good, however, the ratio of bread to salami ratio was super off, the bread was too much it was like WAY too much bread compared to the salami. But, we really liked the flavour combo of the salami with the provolone cheese, peppers and eggplant. 6.8/10.
Prosciutto ($16) - This was the most disappointing one that we tried. There was barely any prosciutto and there wasn‚Äôt much flavour to it. It was not worth it. 6/10.

Overall, I liked it but I wouldn‚Äôt be coming back any time soon. I feel like if I have to add on other things to make the panini better, than it is just not worth the price. The cotoletta panini ended up being $21 because of the add ons.

We ordered off of the app and the order had been updated as 'ready', when we went to collect it the team said it would be out shortly, but I believe they manually select when it is ready?

the food is always soggy and cold and once even covered in oil. i have allergies so i always ask for no onion, however they always give me onion. it is filthy and the wait times are so long, the music is also far too loud. the staff are rude and have on multiple occasions attempted to pressure me into buying a bigger meal or a drink when that is not what i ordered and we‚Äôre very pushy on said stance. they also always are frowning or scowling.

Bolognese arancini was absolutely perfect. Crispy on the outside, moist and flavoursome on the inside.
Wood fired calabrese pizza was very good also. Base was light, and ingredients were very fresh. Slightly too much tomato paste on the base which contributed to a soggy, and no so crispy dough in the middle of the pizza. But overall, still a good pizza.

Service was attentive throughout the whole restaurant, and high level of cleanliness was observed. | came here on my birthday and it did not disappoint. food was very nice, we got a few entrees, meatballs, garlic bread and the bruschetta. i‚Äôd recommend all of them because they were just so good, we also had the lasagne, linguini prawn pasta, grilled chicken risotto, and the meatball pizza.

service was amazing, we had a waitress who was able to speak chinese with some of us, made ordering the food much easier. food was served up pretty fast considering the large amount of people there as well.

atmosphere was very nice as well, dim lighting, nice decorations, and no random decos on the tables that take up space. not to mention the tables and seats were very comfortable as well.

overall great experience i will definitely be coming back, price of the food is 100% worth it, such good quality. | If you are  looking for family friendly meals, well sized and affordable, this is the place. It was a full house on Friday and everyone seemed to be having a good time, we certainly did. | I cannot rate Rococo Hawthorn highly enough.
The Vegano menu was beyond my wildest dreams & Rococo truly delivered!
The staff were happy, friendly and available when needed.
Our group of vegan and meat-eaters were all thrilled with our meals and the food tasted like it was made with love.
I am a fussy eater and could not find fault with anything. Oh and the dessert - OMG ü§§

Food is average, pricy and tends to be a bit bland. Matcha has grainy texture but frothing and art is pretty. | One of my new faves! Everything is delicious and flavourful, and the serving are generous - I recommend the Pork Benny for food and Turkish Delatte if you fancy something decedent and sweet.

This will be on my regular brunch rotations from now on - highly recommend! | Absolutely amazing place and so accommodating. Dan and his team make it easy to dine in. The staff are extremely friendly and very relaxed, they will make sure you get the right order.

Recommend booking in as it does get very busy. Family friendly indoor and outdoor dining. Personal favourite is the portobello mushroom and the pulled pork, my son smashed back the pancakes.
Honestly a really well established and friendly place to eat. | The Nutella Pancakes are to die for. The beautiful blend of mixed berry compote, nutella labne, pistachio, vanilla bean ice cream & maple syrup were incredibly heavenly and tasty. Perfect balance of flavours and not sweet at all. The calamari was super fresh, lightly fried & well seasoned. I ate most of the calamari within seconds hehehe they were soo addictive. I really enjoyed the juicy tender triple fried chicken, it was tasty but I prefer it not in a burger. The lettuce, cheese & pickles just didn't seem to pair that well for some reason. The Sweet Corn Fritters with smashed avo was so so yummy!! The new revamped winter drink is their hot chocolate! Lightly torched marshmallow (think campfire) and chocolate wafer stick. Nice and toasty. Its like a warm hug on a cold day! | Delicious food and warm hospitality. We had a delicious brunch on the weekend.

Returned after a bit of a break to a disappointing experience. The staff were very friendly, the place looks exactly the same as it was a decade back but the food wasn't particularly nice.

The salmon fritters were incredibly dry and tasted like paper and salmon is definitely not the main ingredient by a long shot. An avalanche of onion at the bottom was weird too. Don't say pomegranate in the menu if you literally are throwing in a couple randomly.  The baked eggs were slightly better if very watery and soupy.

Coffees were very good though.

If you like asian desserts, not so sweet style, gooey texture, bubble tea kind of texture and flavour, than you may like this one.

There are so many options to choose from ranging from Thai milk tea mochi to black sesame soup. There was just so much options to choose from and there also was free shaved ice provided with your bowl of you wanted some

Love the self serve option, I love all the mochi like chewy options and taro flavoured things! | It would help if they were more proactive in suggestions on combinations that worked best, offering tasters and welcoming newbies that aren't familiar with the ingredients.

Seems popular with Chinese crowd that knew the best pairings.

Strange decor.

Everything is in the open, exposed to anything airborn,  but there isn't any other way to do the diy concept.

Free sugar and free shaved ice, but minimum spend is $7. Everything is mainly tasteless or bland.

This is our must visit Italian restaurant in Melbourne!!! | The food was exceptionally delicious, the ambiance soothing and pleasant, and the service was outstanding, making me feel like I was back home with a friend and chef cooking in my house. I wish I could eat there every day! üòÇ

We ordered their seasonal menu with three courses (sorry, I was too busy eating to remember the exact names):

ü•ó The first dish was a salad with a dressing featuring black truffle and cheese. The mixed greens were incredibly tasty, with a rich texture. As I don't eat raw meat, my friend mentioned the beef was very tender, allowing the fresh flavor of the beef itself to shine through.

ü•ò The second one, beef with potatoes, was absolutely phenomenal. Even though I typically don't enjoy beef, this Italian restaurant made it so delicious that I couldn't resist. The beef had a grilled flavor, perfectly tender without any chewiness or toughness that often comes with grilled meats. The potatoes dipped in sauce combined with a bite of beef created an amazing sensation in my mouth. I wished I had two stomachs to eat more! üò≠

üçù The third one, white sauce pasta, was also delightful. It had a rich oiliness that wasn't greasy at all. The classic Italian spices mixed with mushroom sauce and black truffle made each bite feel like a serene gondola ride in Venice.

üçÆ Finally, we had tiramisu for dessert. Their tiramisu was sweet but not overly so, leaving me wanting more. You could taste the chef's dedication in every layer of cream and cake‚Äîit felt like love put into a dessert!

I must also mention the service. The waiters who served us were attentive and thoughtful. When they heard that I can't drink alcohol, they kindly recommended non-alcoholic pairings for our meal. Their service was truly heartwarming, like having caring brothers or sisters nearby.  This restaurant definitely deserves 5 stars. Come and eat!

Many thanks to Marwell and Yang Shen, as well as the other staff for their warm service, which made our dinner very enjoyable. The pleasant atmosphere of the restaurant made us feel relaxed. We've even planned what to eat on our next visit.

If this restaurant improves on service then I have no doubt it will have people queuing outside. Maybe that's something that the owners do not want. Who knows!

Food:
- sizzling chicken was delicious. The sound of the sizzle and the blue flame underneath the serving container adds to the flavour.

- pork ribs were simply gorgeous. I can still feel their taste. Not because I haven't brushed or showered in days, but because they were absolutely delicious. Although, the sprinkled salt was a bit overdone.

I'm actually from Brisbane but visit this part of the world the 2-3 times a year. I always look forward to coming back to to this coffee shop.
It's just as as good as I remembered it and have written about. Pretty tasty coffee and at what is now really good value prices for food and coffee.

Some improvement in relation to the previous visit - my partner's bowl came with minimal to no gap in the middle of the bowl, however mine still had a whole gap in the middle.

To avoid this (and disappointment from the customer to receiving a 'hole bowl'), I would suggest adding acai on the bottom of the cup, ending with a small swirl in the middle still at the level of half the cup similarly to what other places do (so that a large bowl is actually large in quantity and not having an empty space in the middle, lacking promised quantity as it should do).
Then fill out the toppings in the middle of the bowl and continue with the swirl, passing the upper level of the cup and going up (as they usually do this latter).

Toppings were better and more generous this time.

-----------------

Quite divided what to think of this place! Here's why:

- acai taste is quite bland and portion is deceiving - we found that in comparison to other competitors, it lacks taste of the acai itself. Maybe it's just not a strong acai taste and more bland? Maybe they use more ice or other ingredients besides acai? Not sure. Also it looks like a good portion but actually there is a massive gap in the middle?! These would be the reasons for the 3 star and not 5. Consistency is still good despite the taste and portion.
- toppings - the granola is small in portion but amazing taste and along with the biscoff or nutella sauce (you pay extra but would recommend) is perfect. However it quite sad that with the other toppings you only get 1 strawberry (just 1, seriously?) and less than half banana. Again why I am giving 3 stars.
- price is reasonable

Looks more impressive than what it actually is - it definitely quite a few things to improve! | Ivanhoe East is so fortunate to have The Lorri in the area! It is full of buzz and professionally run by an an amazing Family. The food, service and atmosphere is exceptional quality and never wavers. It doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all that The Lorri is packed out day in day out. Places like this add to the community of Ivanhoe especially by the people operating the business. | The a√ßai here is the best in Melbourne! It‚Äôs great quality, so smooth. There are lots of toppings to choose from. Wish there was more seating space inside but no big deal. | Smoothies are killer. Only downfall is the place never has enough staff on and is constantly making customers stand at the counter waiting to get served while they ignore you and continue making a√ßai bowls just plain rude.

Don‚Äôt come unless you have a spare half an hour up your sleeve to wait for a smoothie. The girls are so lovely and are just doing there best, but they need help!

What hurts small businesses is responses like these to google reviews. I was polite and respectful in my interaction. I wrote this after months of waiting half an hour and being ignored at counter. Which they mentioned this ‚Äúis done on purpose to slow the line down because of the school kids‚Äù
To my surprise I come in after giving this review to have staff have a go at me and try to get me to delete it. I‚Äôve never been made to feel so uncomfortable in my life or seen a more unprofessional way of handling feedback. | The service was unremarkable. Not bad but not enough to want to go back for more. The a√ßai tasted more like banana than a√ßai. The list of toppings was excellent. We loved that there was an option to order nut free granola but were disappointed to be told they had run out and we could not substitute it for something else unless we paid extra.

Three of us dined for under $120, and we even had leftovers to take home. The restaurant also offers set menus at $70 pp (including sukiyaki) or $50 pp. The couples at the next table were enjoying the set meals, which looked varied and generously portioned.

- Entree: Tempura $15
The tempura consisted of 8-9 pieces and was a delightful start to our meal. I must say, the suburban pricing is quite reasonable.

- Unagi Sushi $22
I particularly loved the unagi sushi here, with its subtle charcoal aroma. I devoured half of it myself, thanks to my dining companions :)

- Sushi Boat $38
This dish, also listed as House Moriawase, is supposedly a single serving, but it was more than enough for the three of us. The ingredients were fresh, and the sashimi had a delicate sweetness.

- Wafu Steak $34
The beef was incredibly tender, melting in the mouth with a rich, flavorful sauce. It was accompanied by a side of vegetables, making for a balanced and satisfying dish.

- Nabeyaki Udon $20
The udon was perfectly chewy and a broth that was rich and flavorful. It was nice and comforting.

Many of the patrons seemed to be local residents, adding to their homely vibe. If I had to point out a flaw, it would be the slightly slow service, possibly due to the weekend crowd. | A very average Japanese restaurant that clearly was quite popular in the area.

We had the sushi boat, beef yaki soba, teriyaki chicken roll and agedashi tofu.

I ordered coffee with croissants. The coffee was very bad, and after a quarter of an hour, he did not bring the croissants. I went to them and they said that the chef is not in the kitchen and I must wait, so I told them.  I didn't want to, so she returned the money to me, but the amount was incorrect, and she gave me the balance, but the amount was not correct, and the workers insisted that I was the wrong one. Unfortunately, manager, your management is a failure. Finally, when they brought the coffee, the waitress was cleaning the shop in front of me and in front of some customers, and I told her, ‚ÄúMy table is not clean.‚Äù She took the dishes and left them without cleaning them, unfortunately."

A few small notes for improvement though - The double espresso can sometimes be quite watery and acidic, which is understandable given the peak coffee-rush on most mornings which leads to a higher running temperature of the machine. The cold brew has also sometimes tasted a bit 'mossy' due to either the water that was used during production, or fridge/open air oxidation, or perhaps the overall flavour profile of the beans that are used.

My friend also got one and her fillet was the same size. Notable size difference to what is advertised. I‚Äôve had the chicken burger in the past, it was good and a decent size.

We ordered two burgers, a large fries and one thick shake at 8:00pm last night. In total, 3 customers to literally 6 staff including the others waiting. It would take 30 minutes for our order to be finished, despite this.

In that time, four of the staff members were mainly arguing and talking by the food warmers. They didn‚Äôt interact at all with the young girl serving at the window, so while we frustrated customers were outside, she didn‚Äôt have any answers to provide us (not her fault at all). They ignored her and us for most of the 30 minutes.

It turned out our food had been cooked and sitting under a warmer for who knows how long, and we were waiting 30 minutes on a milkshake.

No explanation, no offer to substitute the milkshake to save our time, no partial refund. When we walked the less than 5 min home, the burgers were lukewarm and the fries cold. We debated microwaving it all but were too hungry by that time.

For $52? What a joke. Plenty of great spots on high street for a similar price point with better service. | I had the beef n bacon double it was pretty good In terms of freshness. Everything looked and tasted super fresh. My only issue was the sauce it needed some more flavour to really kick the burger in high gear. I believe that when making a burger if you find the balance between meety flavour and sauce it would be an absolute smash. The chips were really crispy and not too salty. | Burger looked exactly the way advertised. Beef was on point and seasoned perfectly. Not a big fan of fried chicken but their southern fried bites made me change my mind. However, potato fries could be improved.

The chicken dumplings were perfectly steamed and packed with savoury fillings, while the kimchi noodles had just the right amount of kick to tantalise our taste buds, the chilli sauce used was amazing. The lemon chicken was a standout dish, with a tangy sauce that complemented the tender mock meat beautifully. And let's not forget the coconut rice ‚Äì fragrant, fluffy, and the perfect accompaniment to our meal.

To top it all off, the desserts were simply divine. The vegan ice cream was a refreshing treat, the selection and range was outstanding, it was difficult to choose one and I was able to try different flavours!

When we arrived, I asked my husband to go pay for our meal. He mentioned that our daughter was 2 years old, but they told him that kids are half-price regardless of age, so he paid for her. I then went to the counter to show them the Instagram conversation, and they refunded us.

At the hoppers station, although the food was fresh and delicious, I noticed that the server was bringing hoppers to other customers at their tables. I asked if he could do the same for us, but he said they don't normally do that. When I questioned why he did it for other customers, he couldn't provide a clear answer.

I ended up waiting for my hoppers while he served fresh ones to other customers. When it was finally my turn, he left them for me to collect, but other customers took them. He insisted that I had to wait there for a new batch, even though he was delivering fresh ones to others.

Overall, I found the service to be very inconsistent and felt discriminated against. The buffet selection was limited, and the food was just okay.

Small place with bar seating only inside and some table seating on the street. Had an early lunch so service was great. Friendly staff. | Was unable to seat our party out of the rain and inside so bought takeaway instead. Enjoyed a falafel salad with pita bread. Liked the two different types of falafel.

Did have an upset stomach later in the day but think that was vacinne related so do not think it was food related. Excluding Tahina from that picture. | Tahina is one of the best falafels in Melbourne!! Super crispy yet not dry at all and packed with ingredients (tons of falafel) so it‚Äôs great value for money!!

Cauliflower was also very flavourful and yummy!! Service was quick too so it‚Äôs worth the wait during busy periods.
